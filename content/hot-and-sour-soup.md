### Ingredients

- Ginger, ~1/2 cm, minced
- Water or stock, 2 cups
- Seasoning: soy sauce (生抽), ½ tsp; salt, ½ tsp; chicken bouillon powder (鸡粉), ¼ tsp
- Slurry: 1.5 tbsp starch - preferably root vegetable starch like potato (土豆生粉), tapioca (木薯淀粉), or waterchestnut (马蹄粉) – mixed with 3 tbsp of water
- Egg, 1, beaten
- Dark Chinese vinegar (陈醋 or 香醋), 1 tbsp
- White pepper powder (白胡椒粉), ½ tsp
- Chopped scallion to garish

If you’re using stock, you can skip the chicken bouillon powder. Maybe add a sprinkle (~1/16 tsp) of MSG instead.

### Steps

1. Fry the ginger in a bit of oil – lard, preferably – until fragrant. Add in the water (or stock). Bring up to a boil, then down to a simmer, and season.

1. Make sure the flame is on low, and drizzle in the starch slurry in bit by bit to thicken, stirring constantly. 

1. Keep the flame on low and drop in your beaten egg in spoonfuls. If you instead want to pour the egg in, instead turn the heat off and stir constantly while pouring a small stream.

1. Mix in the vinegar and the white pepper powder. Transfer to a serving bowl, sprinkle over a bit of chopped scallions.
