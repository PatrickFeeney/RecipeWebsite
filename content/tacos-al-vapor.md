### Ingredients

- 1 1/3 lbs fingerling potato peeled and washed
- 3 tbs chipotles in adobo pureed or shredded
- 12 cloves garlic
- 2 sprigs of thyme
- 1 1/4 cups butter
- 2 tbs salt
- 24 corn tortillas
- 1/2 green cabbage shredded

### Steps

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.
1. In a casserole dish, add the potatoes, chipotles, garlic, thyme sprigs, 2 tbs salt then pour over the butter. Bake for 45 mins.
1. Once the potatoes are cooked, remove from the oven and leave to stand for 20 mins or so. Separate butter from everything else, blending together everything else while reserving the butter.
1. Warm up tortillas by dipping in leftover cooking butter. Warm on a low heat griddle and work quickly to assemble tacos. Can also fry on medium heat and skip next two steps.
1. In a warm heavy pot, off the heat, line with about 5 layers of parchment paper and stack the tacos on their side like bricks. Stuff hot tortillas with potato filling.
1. Let rest covered for an hour.
1. Remove from pot as needed to eat and garnish with your favorite salsa and shredded cabbage.
